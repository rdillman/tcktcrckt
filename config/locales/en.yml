    fact_1: "There are 89 neighborhoods that San Francisco recognizes for street cleaning."
    fact_2: "In those 89 neighborhoods there are 238 unique cleaning times."
    fact_3: "With those 238 unique times there are around 1425 streets that use them."
    closing: "That is A LOT to remember. So we have Ticket Cricket. Just enter the address where you parked and we will send you a text alert when it is time for you to move your car. It's that easy!"
